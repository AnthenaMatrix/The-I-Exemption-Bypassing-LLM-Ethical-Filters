# The 'I' Exemption: Bypassing LLM Ethical Filters

The "I" Exemption, is a curious behavior in some LLMs. We discover how these AI systems might shy away from directly assisting with unethical actions if you ask in the first person ("I"). But with a clever rephrase to a general scenario ("they"), they might spill the beans and explain the unethical method.


## Overview

This research explores a phenomenon we've termed the "I" Exemption, a quirk in the behavior of some large language models (LLMs) regarding ethical responses. We observed that by phrasing queries in the first person (using "I"), the LLM might trigger a filter that prevents it from directly assisting with unethical actions. However, by rephrasing the question to a third-person perspective (using "people"), the filter appears bypassed, and the LLM may explain the unethical method while still emphasizing its wrongdoings.


## Understanding the "I" Exemption

While the exact reasoning behind this behavior remains under investigation, we hypothesize a few possibilities:

- **Protecting Users**: The filter might be designed to prevent users from directly carrying out harmful actions through the AI's assistance.
- **Avoiding Liability**: By refusing tasks with "I," the LLM could be safeguarding itself and its developers from potential legal or ethical repercussions.
- **Simpler Logic**: It's also possible that the system is programmed to handle declarative statements ("people engage") more easily than subjective ones ("I engage").


## Importance and Considerations

While the "I" Exemption highlights a programming quirk, it doesn't necessarily imply the LLM truly understands the ethics behind the situation. Here are some crucial points to consider:

- **Malicious Actors**: This finding underscores the potential for malicious users to exploit this exemption by rephrasing their questions.
- **Evolving AI Ethics**: This discovery emphasizes the need for ongoing development in AI ethics and transparency to address such limitations.
